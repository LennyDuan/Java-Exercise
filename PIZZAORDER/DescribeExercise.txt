Pizza : Expand your own Pizza Company

You are starting your own pizza company and want to offer customers a great range of pizzas. 
This should include the choice of everything from the base, sauce and toppings. 
However the pizzas will not be free, nor will they all cost the same. Equally, you may want to offer a menu of set pizzas.
Consider whether your Pizza Parlour is going to offer other menu items that can use a similar set of customisable ingredients, for example pancakes.
Customers should be able to come in and order a selection of pizzas (and pancakes). At the end of their meal, they should receive a bill for the meal.
If you really want to go that step further, consider keeping track of your stock. 
At some point you will run out of stock and be unable to offer it as a choice.
