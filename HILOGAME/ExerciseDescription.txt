// Ecercise 1: A simple game of HiLo using objects
// In this game, the player has to guess a number. For each guess, they are told whether the number is higher or lower than their guess. The number of guesses may be limited, and the range of numbers to guess from could be altered. Your final model should include a game manager and different players, but start simply with the game itself, a single player and functionality to maintain scores.
// When you have a basic game working, consider different computer strategies for this game, implementing a couple of computer player strategies.
// If you want to have interaction with the user during run-time, you may find the following useful. A simple utility to read input from the command line in Java is called a Scanner. We will be covering this in more detail in later lectures, but for the time being here is an example. Note: in order to use the Scanner, you must first tell Java to import it:
// import java.util.Scanner;! //Goes at the top of you program ! before the class declaration
// System.out.println("Please enter some text for me to read using the
// 		Scanner");
// Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
// String input = reader.nextLine();
// Remember that if they enter a number, you can convert this to a number based type such as Integer:
// int guess = Integer.parseInt(input);
// Feel free to practice the concepts covered in the lecture with other examples or ideas you may have. Remember: If you have any problems, feel free to ask.
