Bank
A bank has many accounts, each of which are associated with a person who is a customer at the bank. The accounts should each have a unique account number, and remember a list of transactions. There are different types of accounts, such as savings account or current accounts with different properties associated to them. The transactions should contain details about the time and date, the amount of money, and the type of transaction, e.g. withdrawing or transferring money to another account.
You should produce a model for this application before trying to implement it. In your model, you should consider the use of interfaces, and abstract classes. Label the arrows to indicate where one class extends or implements another. Include the data types of fields and whether they are class or instance variables. Repeat for the methods, indicating return types and parameters.
Only when you are happy with your model start to write the code to implement the various classes involved. Where appropriate, remember polymorphism and think about the static and dynamic data types for declaring variables.
