#### Tournament: An example of bjected-oriented programming 
###### I built a system to automate the recording of tournament results - a list of players is made, and they are assigned matches, the results are recorded and the next set of matches are arranged until there is a winner. The interface was made in WindowBuilder GUI, with data stored in XML. It was an exercise in advanced design, so i have made use of appropriate design patterns.
